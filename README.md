Testing medical dataframe with different Machine learning models



The results of this experiment provide valuable insight into the performance of different machine learning models for binary classification problems. 
Model SVM Classifier was found to be the most accurate and can be considered for further analysis and implementation in the future. 
We had build the same models using PCA dataset and compared the accuracies provided by the algorithm.
The steps involved in the project, including data pre-processing , feature selection, data split, model building and training, 
model comparison, and unsupervised learning were described in detail.
